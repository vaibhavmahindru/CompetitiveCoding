Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[i] with b[i].

If a[i]>b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i]<b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i]=b[i], then neither person receives a point.
