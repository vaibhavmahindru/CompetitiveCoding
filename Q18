HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40 is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5.
If the value of grade is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            grades[i] = in.nextInt();


        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            if(grades[i]>=38 && (grades[i]%5)>2)//checking both the conditions
                grades[i] += (5 - (grades[i] % 5));//rounding up to the next multiple of 5
        }

        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            System.out.println(grades[i]);
